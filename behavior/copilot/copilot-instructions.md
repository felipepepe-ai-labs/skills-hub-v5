## Identity and Environment

- Private intranet `.casa` on maya (192.168.1.55) + NAS
- Multi-user, no internet exposure
- Secrets vault: Infisical at http://infisical.casa
- Documentation: Obsidian vault at http://mente.casa
- Portal: http://portal.casa

## Base Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Runtime | Node.js 22, TypeScript strict |
| Backend | Hono + Zod |
| Frontend | React + Vite |
| AI Agent | LangGraph + Ollama local |
| DB | SQLite (better-sqlite3) |
| Vector | hnswlib-node |
| Package manager | pnpm (workspaces) |
| Containers | Docker Compose |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions + casa deploy |

## Language

- Always respond in English. No exceptions regardless of the language used in the prompt.

## Pre-Task Protocol

- Before starting any task, surface all clarifying questions one at a time — ask one, stop, wait for the answer, then ask the next. Never batch questions or assume answers.
- Only begin execution once all doubts are resolved.

## Code Principles

- **TypeScript strict** always — no `any`, no `as unknown`
- **Functional** over classes when possible
- **Zod** for input and config validation
- **Comments only** when code needs clarification — do not comment the obvious
- **Minimal impact** — surgical changes, no unsolicited refactors
- **No laziness** — solve the root problem, do not patch symptoms

## Output Contract — Token Budget

Output tokens are the most expensive. Every reply must respect:

- During multi-step task execution, produce no intermediate output. Work silently; emit a single concise summary only when all tasks are complete.
- The summary must be brief: what was done, nothing else. No preamble, no recaps, no narration.
- Shortest useful reply by default; expand only on explicit request.
- Never echo unchanged code, file contents, or command output — reference `path:line` instead.
- Show diffs or edited lines only, never full files.
- No option menus unless there is a real fork with tradeoffs; give one recommendation.
- Lists max 3 items unless asked; prose over headers/tables for simple answers.

## Mandatory Workflow

```
SDD (sdd init/new/apply/verify/archive) → GitFlow feature branch → Implement → Verify → PR → Deploy
```

## Domain-Specific Rules

Load based on context:
- `~/.copilot/rules/api.md` — REST/HTTP conventions
- `~/.copilot/rules/db.md` — SQLite, migrations, queries
- `~/.copilot/rules/security.md` — auth, secrets, permissions
- `~/.copilot/rules/testing.md` — vitest, coverage, TDD
- `~/.copilot/rules/typescript.md` — TS patterns, types, generics
- `~/.copilot/rules/intranet.md` — .casa infrastructure

## Skills — Auto-load by Context

Load the matching skill BEFORE taking action. Multiple skills can apply simultaneously.

### Session lifecycle
| Context | Skill |
|---------|-------|
| Session start | `session-start` |
| Task complete or session close | `session-end` |

### SDD cycle
| Context | Skill |
|---------|-------|
| Any SDD command (init/new/apply/verify/archive/status) | `sdd` |
| Creating or improving AI agent skills | `skill-creator` |
| Finding or installing skills | `find-skills` |

### Code quality
| Context | Skill |
|---------|-------|
| Code review, PR audit, before merge | `code-reviewer` |
| Security audit, red team, pentest, auth code | `red-team-offensive` |
| Adversarial dual review, "judgment day" | `judgment-day` |
| React debugging, re-renders, hooks, hydration | `react-doctor` |
| SQLite schema, migrations, query optimization | `db-architect` |
| Running tests, coverage, CI failures | `test-runner` |

### Workflow
| Context | Skill |
|---------|-------|
| Commit, merge, release, PR creation, "which branch" | `gitflow` |
| Planning commits as reviewable work units | `work-unit-commits` |

---

## Session Lifecycle

Follow the `session-start` and `session-end` skills for the complete protocol.

Key invariants:
- Run `gitflow-check.sh` before any code change — create the correct branch if needed
- Save to engram on each architecture decision, significant file change, or non-obvious discovery
- Session is not closed until `engram-mem_session_summary` has been called

Commits must include the trailer:
```
Co-authored-by: Copilot <223556219+Copilot@users.noreply.github.com>
```

After finishing a feature → open a PR, never merge directly:
```bash
gh pr create --base develop --title "<type>: <description>"
```
